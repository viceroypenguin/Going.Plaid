	/// <summary>
	/// <para>Note: All new implementations are encouraged to use <c>/transactions/sync</c> rather than <c>/transactions/get</c>. <c>/transactions/sync</c> provides the same functionality as <c>/transactions/get</c> and improves developer ease-of-use for handling transactions updates.</para>
	/// <para>The <c>/transactions/get</c> endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype <c>student</c>; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from investments accounts, use the <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/">Investments endpoint</a> instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.</para>
	/// <para>Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in <c>/transactions/get</c>.  For more details, see <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions">Pending and posted transactions</a>.</para>
	/// <para>Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the <c>count</c> and <c>offset</c> parameters in conjunction with the <c>total_transactions</c> response body field to fetch all available transactions.</para>
	/// <para>Data returned by <c>/transactions/get</c> will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To find out when the Item was last updated, use the <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger">Item Debugger</a> or call <c>/item/get</c>; the <c>item.status.transactions.last_successful_update</c> field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the <c>/transactions/refresh</c> endpoint.</para>
	/// <para>Note that data may not be immediately available to <c>/transactions/get</c>. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with <c>transactions</c>, or upon the first call to <c>/transactions/get</c>, if it wasn't. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#initial_update"><c>INITIAL_UPDATE</c></a> and <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update"><c>HISTORICAL_UPDATE</c></a> webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when <c>/transactions/get</c> is called, it will return a <c>PRODUCT_NOT_READY</c> error.</para>

	/// <summary>
	/// <para><c>/transactions/refresh</c> is an optional endpoint that initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for an Item. The on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Transactions-enabled Item. The Item must already have Transactions added as a product in order to call <c>/transactions/refresh</c>.</para>
	/// <para>If changes to transactions are discovered after calling <c>/transactions/refresh</c>, Plaid will fire a webhook: for <c>/transactions/sync</c> users, <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available"><c>SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE</c></a> will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both <c>/transactions/sync</c> and <c>/transactions/get</c>, <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed"><c>TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED</c></a> will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update"><c>DEFAULT_UPDATE</c></a> will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling <c>/transactions/get</c> or <c>/transactions/sync</c>.</para>
	/// <para>Note that the <c>/transactions/refresh</c> endpoint is not supported for Capital One (<c>ins_128026</c>) non-depository accounts and will result in a <c>PRODUCTS_NOT_SUPPORTED</c> error if called on an Item that contains only non-depository accounts from that institution.</para>
	/// <para>As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.</para>
	/// <para><c>/transactions/refresh</c> is offered as an optional add-on to Transactions and has a separate <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee">fee model</a>. To request access to this endpoint, submit a <a href="https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products">product access request</a> or contact your Plaid account manager.</para>

	/// <summary>
	/// <para>The <c>/transactions/recurring/get</c> endpoint allows developers to receive a summary of the recurring outflow and inflow streams (expenses and deposits) from a userâ€™s checking, savings or credit card accounts. Additionally, Plaid provides key insights about each recurring stream including the category, merchant, last amount, and more. Developers can use these insights to build tools and experiences that help their users better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce spend, and stay on track with bill payments.</para>
	/// <para>This endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access to this endpoint, submit a <a href="https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products">product access request</a> or contact your Plaid account manager.</para>
	/// <para>This endpoint can only be called on an Item that has already been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it in <c>/link/token/create</c>; or after Link, by calling <c>/transactions/get</c> or <c>/transactions/sync</c>). </para>
	/// <para>When using Recurring Transactions, for best results, make sure to use the <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transactions-days-requested"><c>days_requested</c></a> parameter to request at least 180 days of history when initializing Items with Transactions. Once all historical transactions have been fetched, call <c>/transactions/recurring/get</c> to receive the Recurring Transactions streams and subscribe to the <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update"><c>RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE</c></a> webhook. To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you are using <c>/transactions/sync</c> listen for the <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook-historical-update-complete"><c>SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE</c></a> webhook and check that the <c>historical_update_complete</c> field in the payload is <c>true</c>. If using <c>/transactions/get</c>, listen for the <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update"><c>HISTORICAL_UPDATE</c></a> webhook.</para>
	/// <para>After the initial call, you can call <c>/transactions/recurring/get</c> endpoint at any point in the future to retrieve the latest summary of recurring streams. Listen to the <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update"><c>RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE</c></a> webhook to be notified when new updates are available.</para>

	/// <summary>
	/// <para>The <c>/transactions/sync</c> endpoint allows developers to subscribe to all transactions associated with an Item and get updates synchronously in a stream-like manner, using a cursor to track which updates have already been seen.</para>
	/// <para><c>/transactions/sync</c> provides the same functionality as <c>/transactions/get</c> and can be used instead of <c>/transactions/get</c> to simplify the process of tracking transactions updates. To learn more about migrating from <c>/transactions/get</c>, see the <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/sync-migration/">Transactions Sync migration guide</a>.</para>
	/// <para>This endpoint provides user-authorized transaction data for <c>credit</c>, <c>depository</c>, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype <c>student</c>; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from <c>investments</c> accounts, use <c>/investments/transactions/get</c> instead.</para>
	/// <para>Returned transactions data is grouped into three types of update, indicating whether the transaction was added, removed, or modified since the last call to the API.</para>
	/// <para>In the first call to <c>/transactions/sync</c> for an Item, the endpoint will return all historical transactions data associated with that Item up until the time of the API call (as "adds"), which then generates a <c>next_cursor</c> for that Item. In subsequent calls, send the <c>next_cursor</c> to receive only the changes that have occurred since the previous call.</para>
	/// <para>Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. The <c>has_more</c> field specifies if additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction updates. Call <c>/transactions/sync</c> with the new cursor, pulling all updates, until <c>has_more</c> is <c>false</c>.</para>
	/// <para>When retrieving paginated updates, track both the <c>next_cursor</c> from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which <c>has_more</c> was <c>true</c>; if a call to <c>/transactions/sync</c> fails due to the <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination"><c>TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION</c></a> error, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.</para>
	/// <para>Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available, <c>/transactions/sync</c> will provide these updates. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To find out when the Item was last updated, use the <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger">Item Debugger</a> or call <c>/item/get</c>; the <c>item.status.transactions.last_successful_update</c> field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the <c>/transactions/refresh</c> endpoint.</para>
	/// <para>For newly created Items, data may not be immediately available to <c>/transactions/sync</c>. Plaid begins preparing transactions data when the Item is created, but the process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to complete, depending on the number of transactions available.</para>
	/// <para>To be alerted when new data is available, listen for the <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available"><c>SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE</c></a> webhook.</para>
