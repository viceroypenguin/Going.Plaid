	/// <para>Update the status of a Beacon User.</para>
	/// <para>When updating a Beacon User's status via this endpoint, Plaid validates that the status change is consistent with the related state for this Beacon User. Specifically, we will check:</para>

	/// <para>2. Whether there are any confirmed Beacon Report Syndications connected to the Beacon User.</para>
	/// <para>When updating a Beacon User's status to "rejected", we enforce that either a Beacon Report has been created for the Beacon User or a Beacon Report Syndication has been confirmed.</para>
	/// <para>When updating a Beacon User's status to "cleared", we enforce that there are no active Beacon Reports or confirmed Beacon Report Syndications associated with the user. If you previously created a Beacon Report for this user, you must delete it before updating the Beacon User's status to "cleared".</para>
	/// <para>There are no restrictions on updating a Beacon User's status to "pending_review".</para>
